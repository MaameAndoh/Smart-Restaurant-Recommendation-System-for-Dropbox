Hello! During fall 2023 I collaborated with peers under the Break Through Tech program at the MIT Schwarzman School of Computing, to develop
a smart restaurant recommendation system for Dropbox. 
We worked closely to with Challenge Advisors from Dropbox and were provided the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings. 

My team members were [Maura Anish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maura-anish/), [Miraya Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miraya-gupta-878321210/), 
[Sabrina Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiarui-sabrina-lu-a0566a250/), [Sandy Zheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandyzheng/), and [Vivian Kwong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivian-kwong-95baa4199/). 

We split into subgroups to focus on two algorithms: collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering. Sandy, Vivian, and I worked on the latter option, 
and the code provided is from our efforts.
